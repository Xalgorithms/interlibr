# Summary

This is Interlibr - a document-oriented map/reduce platform for the
Internet of Rules. The platform runs on Kubernetes and Docker Compose
(for development). It uses design concepts from the
[SMACK](https://mesosphere.com/blog/smack-stack-new-lamp-stack/)
(Spark, ~~Mesos~~, Akka, Cassandra, Kafka) collection of
frameworks. This platform is [designed](./docs/arch-2.0.md) to retain,
discover and execute [rules](./docs/xalgo.md) against documents
(hierarchical key-value maps aka JSON documents).

# Components

The platform is made up of a number of independent services and
support libraries:

| Component                                                                          | Category   | Language   | Core Technologies | Description                                                             |
